                            CycleWealth is India's first integrated circular economy platform that connects
                            households, scrap dealers, artisans, and recycling startups. We transform the
                            way waste is managed by creating a seamless ecosystem where waste becomes a
                            valuable resource, benefiting both people and the planet.

                        <h2>The Problem We Address</h2>
                        <p>
                            India generates over 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with less than 20%
                            being properly recycled. Waste management remains fragmented, inefficient, and
                            environmentally harmful. Households struggle to find reliable scrap dealers,
                            artisans lack access to quality recycled materials, and the informal recycling
                            sector operates without transparency or fair pricing.
